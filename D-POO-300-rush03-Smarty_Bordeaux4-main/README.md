## What we have to do
On this project, we were asked to comment on everything. ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING. So we had to imagine a solution where moderation would be restricted or non-existent. We first had to think about the design of our project and then do the web development side. 

## Some Features
- Search, interpret and transform data auround the theme of Smart City
- Create an app based on our probelematic, found with the data
- Make some [Axios Requests](https://axios-http.com/docs/post_example) from the browser
- Display points (from our previously created database on a map)
- Supports the [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) API
- Intercept request and response
- Transform request and response data
- Authentication with the Login

## My-app Part Installing
After retrieving the my-app folder, we point to it with the command:

```bash
$ cd my-app
```

We then install all the necessary dependencies to launch the project with the command

```bash
$ npm install
```

And finally we can launch the project

```bash
$ npm start
```
## Api Part Installing
We then redo the manipulation for the back. After retrieving the api folder, we point to it with the command:

```bash
$ cd api
```

We then install all the necessary dependencies to launch strapi with the command

```bash
$ npm install
```

And finally we can launch the backend:

```bash
$ nodemon .
```
To be able to access the app, you have to downoload [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client)
## Technos
For this project, we were forced to develop our app in [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and we chose [Mongo Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/lp/try4?utm_source=google&utm_campaign=search_gs_pl_evergreen_atlas_core_prosp-brand_gic-null_emea-fr_ps-all_desktop_eng_lead&utm_term=mongodb%20atlas%20console&utm_medium=cpc_paid_search&utm_ad=e&utm_ad_campaign_id=12212624521&adgroup=115749705023&gclid=Cj0KCQjw4omaBhDqARIsADXULuXPoyNarbbd_-I7SwH2-Wh-nYqD-WZYQmaeiqOjwuxX2il5cIHmbsYaAiR8EALw_wcB) and [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)to manage the database and requests

## Other Part
We first went through a brainstorming and prototyping phase before developing our application. This allowed us to consolidate our project and to base it on solid foundations
